[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sckott/habanero.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sckott/habanero)

This is a low level client for working with Crossref's search API. It's been named to be more generic, as other organizations are/will adopt Crossref's search API, making it possible to ineract with all from one client. 

### python 2/3

I typically use Python `2.x` locally, but I've just been working on making `habanero` compatible with `2.x` and `3.x`. Please let me know if anything is broken on either version. 

### Installation

```
sudo pip install git+git://github.com/sckott/habanero.git#egg=habanero
